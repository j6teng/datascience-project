# 1.PMI 
Tokenize the given plays and using RDD to collect the required data,coding by pyspark.
Calculating PMI and rank by required order, arrange the RDD for later search interface.
With the information of PMI, when inputing some word, it will print out a list of word with the probility of appearing after the given word from the highest one.


# 2.Personalized Page Rank

Start from the source node with all probability mass, implemented personalized page rank that continue iterating until some specified termination condition is reached


# 3.Spam detection
Implementing a Spark version of the sequential SGD(stochastic gradient descent model trainer .
Build a spam prediction models, using training data sets and  use these models to predict whether the documents in a test data set are spam by calculating the assigned “spamminess” score.
